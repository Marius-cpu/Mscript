# Mscript
simple scripting language with strong Java scanner usage
# Features
Not much, has math(subtraction and addition) a print function that's pretty primitive.
# Usage
compile the program
run it
- use the functions provided by me here:
- printf
- Exit(exits the program)
- math(runs the math function with the two capabilities)
- about(prints something rubbish i've written about the scripting language)
# new features
-Added a graphical interface tackler, example: asks you for a string to input to be displayed on the frame and so on. In early development so I will upload later
